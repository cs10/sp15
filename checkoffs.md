# Lab Check-Off Questions

## Background

**All lab check-off deadlines are at 11:59PM.**
(However, you need to get checked off by a TA or lab assistant, so you last chance to get checked off is during lab or office hours.)

To get checked off, you should prepare answers to **all** of these questions for each lab, though you will only be quizzed on a subset of the questions.

## Lab 1: Welcome to <span class="snap">snap</span>   {#lab1}
No questions for this lab!
