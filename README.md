# [CS10 Spring 2015][site]

[site]: http://cs10.org/sp15

## Background
The Spring 2015 site is built using [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com) and is hosted on Github, with a backup on the CS10 instructional account.

Currently, there isn't much fancy work being done with Jekyll -- just a few include statements and basic page layouts.

## Dependencies

* Bootstrap
* jQuery
* FullCalendarJS -- for the Google Calendar schedule
* MomentJS -- needed for FullCalendar and is a date API used in other places

Note: The use of FullCalendar requires a Google Developer account, but these are free and there shouldn't be much configuration needed. Currently the key is supplied in the index file, but this will move.
